So I whole heartedly believe Ill be able to start getting more content out for the website. After a few months we'll start posting on social media and other music sharing platforms.\nMe and Sam (Ditty) Have been planning something big. Something beyond our control and were excited to finally start bringing these plans into fruition its going to be a good next couple of years in terms of creativity and productivity. AMEN"
